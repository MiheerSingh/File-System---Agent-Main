 Local Filesystem AI Assistant
TypeScript • LangChain • Ollama

Turn plain English into real file actions — all running locally on your machine.

This project is a secure, AI-driven file manager that understands natural language and performs file operations inside a protected workspace directory. Powered by LangChain and a locally hosted Ollama model, it keeps your system safe while giving you smart automation.

 
 What It Can Do

Your AI assistant comes with built-in tools to manage files effortlessly:
 
 Generate files – Instantly create new documents.

 Add or update content – Write structured or generated text into files.

 Read & summarize – Analyze and explain file contents.

 View directory contents – See everything inside your workspace.

 Remove files – Delete files safely when no longer needed.

 Safety First:
All operations are sandboxed within the workspace folder — your system directories remain untouched.
